## Building from Source

First, you will need the WASI target installed in your Rust system:

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
```

Once WASI is available, you can build the WebAssembly binary by yourself with:

```shell
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
```

This will create a new file located at `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/cowsay.wasm`.

When the wasm file is created you can upload it to wasmer or execute it with wasmer:

```shell
wasmer publish
# OR
wasmer run . "Hello World"
```

You can also build a native executable with

```shell
cargo build
```
